    <H1>Fun Facts about Lettie’s Place:</H1>
    <ul>
        <li>Lettie’s Place is named after “Lettie”, the head chicken of our first 5 chickens. They had been raised on someone else’s farm, and so our place was new to them. But Lettie taught the other hens how to search around the property for food, shelter, and shade. She taught me, too. This past winter was too cold for her, and we lost her. When we needed a name for our place, it seemed an appropriate way to keep her part of our farm.</li>
        <li>Lettie was a leghorn. Leghorns lay eggs almost every day.  They are very independent, and like to go where they want to go. I actually really liked that about her. She definitely had her very own personality!</li>
        <li>“Lettie’s Place” is a bookmark name of our business. As my daughters and I explore different directions our business can go, for example, adding more baked goods, jam, etc, the name may change to better reflect our products. But Lettie gave me the motivation I needed to start this endeavor. When things get hard, I think of her and how she searched for what she needed, and led her little pack to find what they needed, to.</li>
        <li>After our first 5 chickens, we got 16 chicks, 15 layers, and one rooster. They started laying eggs between 4 and 5 months old.</li>
        <li>A Few months later, there was a shortage of eggs in the United States! So we decided to hatch our own eggs. We started with 31 eggs and ended up with 24 chicks. 14 of those turned out to be roosters. That’s a lot of roosters!</li>
        <li>By now you would think we had enough, but I was still worried about people having enough eggs, So I ordered 10 more from one hatchery, and picked up 18 more from Cal Ranch. And then a neighbor was passing on some of their chickens., so we took them as well. So for a long time, we had about 84 chickens on our property! That number is now down to 53 layers and 5 roosters.</li>
        <li>Our first rooster’s name was “Nick”</li>
        <li>We now have 5 roosters: Harold, Gerald, Skippy, Sparky, and Stan.</li>
        <li>Roosters do many things to help their hens. Besides protecting them from predators, (including the farmers sometimes), they also help them find food, shelter, and shade. At dusk, the roosters “call” the hens to roost in their safe coops. Thus the name, Roost-ers.</li>
        <li>Our chickens forage around our 1.1 acre to find bugs, seeds, grass, and other greens. In the winter, we feed them grubs, sprouts, sunflower seeds, fruit and vegetable scraps, and other grains.</li>
